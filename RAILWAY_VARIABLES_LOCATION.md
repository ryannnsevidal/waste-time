# üéØ EXACT Steps to Add Environment Variables in Railway

## Current Status:
You should be on your Railway dashboard at railway.app, looking at your "scammer-bot" project.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. **Find Your Services**
You should see TWO boxes/cards on your dashboard:
- **scammer-bot** (your main app)
- **Postgres** (your database)

### 2. **Click on "scammer-bot"** 
- NOT the Postgres one
- Click on the box that says "scammer-bot"

### 3. **Look for Tabs at the Top**
After clicking scammer-bot, you should see tabs like:
```
[Deployments] [Variables] [Settings] [Metrics] [Logs]
```

### 4. **Click the "Variables" Tab**
- This is where you add environment variables
- You should see a page with "+ Add Variable" button

### 5. **Add Each Variable ONE BY ONE**
Click "+ Add Variable" and add:

**Variable 1:**
```
Name: FLASK_ENV
Value: production
```

**Variable 2:**
```
Name: API_KEY
Value: 504e1415ef349991d815cd7b3b91d8dee931664bcfb818d8120dc4aa3327624a
```

**Variable 3:**
```
Name: ADMIN_TOKEN
Value: 1a8cc8eaf1e01ed175204c6de955efc792d8ff1ba40b01953a2d15d48249f130
```

**Variable 4:**
```
Name: SECRET_KEY
Value: 643f8724918f0819b408c380a12cfe4183bf0407092512ea663aeb2b5e07e12b
```

### 6. **What You Should See**
After adding all 4, your Variables page should show:
```
FLASK_ENV = production
API_KEY = 504e1415ef349991d815cd7b3b91d8dee931664bcfb818d8120dc4aa3327624a
ADMIN_TOKEN = 1a8cc8eaf1e01ed175204c6de955efc792d8ff1ba40b01953a2d15d48249f130
SECRET_KEY = 643f8724918f0819b408c380a12cfe4183bf0407092512ea663aeb2b5e07e12b
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://... (this one is auto-added by Railway)
```

## üö® **If You Can't Find "Variables" Tab:**

### Alternative Method:
1. Look for a **gear icon** ‚öôÔ∏è (Settings)
2. Click Settings
3. Look for "Environment Variables" section
4. Add the variables there

### Another Alternative:
1. Look for "Configuration" or "Environment"
2. These might be in a sidebar or dropdown menu

## üì± **Tell Me What You See:**
If you still can't find the Variables section, tell me:
- What tabs do you see at the top?
- What buttons or links are on the page?
- Are there any dropdown menus?

The Variables section is definitely there - Railway requires it for all deployments!
