## 🔍 Finding Variables in Railway Dashboard

### **Current Location: "scammer-bot" Project Page**

You should see one of these layouts:

### **Layout 1: Service-Based Project**
```
scammer-bot (your project)
├── [Overview] [Analytics] [Settings]
└── Services:
    ├── scammer-bot-service (or similar name)
        ├── [Deployments] [Variables] [Settings] [Metrics]
```

### **Layout 2: Simple Project** 
```
scammer-bot (your project)
├── [Deployments] [Variables] [Settings] [Metrics]
```

## 🎯 **What to Look For:**

### **Option A: Look for Tabs at the Top**
- `Deployments` | `Variables` | `Settings` | `Metrics`
- Click **"Variables"** tab

### **Option B: Look for a Service Box**
- You might see a box/card with your project name
- Click on that box first
- Then look for the Variables tab

### **Option C: Look in the Sidebar**
- Variables might be in a left sidebar
- Look for "Environment Variables" or "Variables"

## 🚨 **If You Still Can't Find Variables:**

### **Try This:**
1. **Refresh the page**
2. **Look for any deployments or services** on the dashboard
3. **Click on any service/deployment box you see**
4. **Check if there's a gear icon** ⚙️ (Settings)

### **Alternative Method:**
1. **Click "Settings"** (if you see it)
2. Look for **"Environment Variables"** section
3. Or look for **"Variables"** in settings

## 📱 **Screenshot What You See:**

Can you tell me what you see on your screen? For example:
- Any tabs at the top?
- Any boxes/cards with service names?
- A sidebar on the left?
- What buttons or links do you see?

## 🆘 **Emergency Backup Method:**

If you absolutely can't find Variables, try:
1. **Go back to railway.app main page**
2. **Click your project again**
3. **Look for "Deploy from GitHub"** option
4. **Connect your GitHub repo directly**

This might give you a different interface where Variables are easier to find.
